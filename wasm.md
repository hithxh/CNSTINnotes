# What's webassembly?
WebAssembly is a stack-based virtual machine. It has its own set of instructions, but the machine responsible for executing them is virtual—it’s just another process on your computer.

The instruction set used by WebAssembly is **portable**. This means that it’s impossible to express something in WebAssembly bytecode that will work on one machine but not another. Stack-based virtual machines like WebAssembly are **fast** because the code to manage stacks and perform operations on those stacks is actually very simple and can be highly optimised. WebAssembly binary files are also **small**. Depending on what you’re building, fully functioning wasm files are measured in kilobytes, not megabytes or gigabytes.
